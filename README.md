## 🎯 TL;DR

We show that **scaling a function's running time** (multiplying by a constant $\alpha \neq 1$) is an **expansive homeomorphism** on the space of complexity functions. This single fact yields, via standard dynamical-systems machinery:

- **Stable sets = complexity classes**: functions whose orbits stay close are exactly those with comparable asymptotic growth.
- **Exact hyperbolicity**: distances contract by $1/\alpha$ per forward iterate and expand by $\alpha$ per backward iterate — no approximation, no hidden constants.
- **Hierarchy theorem as orbit separation**: the classical time hierarchy theorem of Hartmanis–Stearns corresponds to orbits being pulled apart under iteration.
- **Entropy dichotomy**: topological entropy is either zero (finite invariant sets) or at least $\log\alpha$ (infinite ones).

In short: **dynamical systems and computational complexity share the same underlying geometry**, and the complexity quasi-metric is the right space to see it.

## 📄 Abstract

The complexity quasi-metric, introduced by Schellekens, provides a topological framework where the asymmetric nature of computational comparisons finds precise mathematical expression. In this paper we develop a comprehensive theory of expansive homeomorphisms on complexity quasi-metric spaces. Our central result establishes that the scaling transformation is expansive, leading to a full characterisation of stable and unstable sets and a hyperbolicity theorem in canonical coordinates. We connect orbit separation to the time hierarchy theorem and derive topological entropy estimates.

## 🔬 Main results

| # | Result | Statement |
|---|--------|-----------|
| 1 | **Expansiveness characterisation** (Theorem 5.8) | The scaling map $\psi_\alpha(f)(n) = \alpha f(n)$ is expansive on $(\mathcal{C}, d_\mathcal{C})$ if and only if $\alpha \neq 1$. |
| 2 | **Stable sets = complexity classes** (Theorem 6.3) | The $\delta$-stable sets of $\psi_\alpha$ coincide with $d_\mathcal{C}$-neighbourhoods and contain all functions that are asymptotically at least as slow. |
| 3 | **Unstable sets** (Theorem 6.7) | The $\delta$-unstable set of $f$ consists of all functions pointwise bounded above by $f$. |
| 4 | **Hyperbolicity** (Theorem 7.3) | Forward iterates contract distances exactly: $d_\mathcal{C}(\psi_\alpha^n(f), \psi_\alpha^n(g)) = \alpha^{-n} \, d_\mathcal{C}(f,g)$, with optimal constant $C = 1$. |
| 5 | **Hierarchy as orbit separation** (Theorem 8.1) | If $f(n)\log f(n) = o(g(n))$, then the symmetrised orbits eventually separate — recovering the time hierarchy theorem dynamically. |
| 6 | **Entropy dichotomy** (Corollary 9.5) | Topological entropy of $\psi_\alpha$ restricted to a compact invariant set is $0$ if the set is finite, and $\geq \log\alpha$ otherwise. |
